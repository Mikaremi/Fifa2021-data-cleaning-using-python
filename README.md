# Fifa2021-data-cleaning-using-python
This project aims to clean a FIFA 21 dataset using Python, ensuring data consistency and cleanliness for further analysis. The process involves importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset, adjusting display options, checking data types and null values, and executing specific cleaning steps for various columns.

Project Requirments:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Fifa 2021 dataset

The FIFA 21 dataset, a comprehensive collection of player statistics and attributes, requires thorough cleaning to ensure data consistency and integrity for accurate analysis. The dataset contains various inconsistencies, such as missing values, incorrect data types, and formatting discrepancies, hindering its usability for meaningful insights and decision-making.
The objective of this project is to clean the FIFA 21 dataset using Python, addressing specific data quality issues to prepare it for further analysis. By ensuring data cleanliness and consistency, we aim to enable data-driven decision-making and facilitate insightful exploration of player attributes and performance metrics.

The scope of the project includes: Importing necessary libraries and the FIFA 21 dataset. Identifying and addressing missing values, incorrect data types, and formatting inconsistencies. Executing cleaning tasks for specific columns, such as removing leading spaces, extracting contract information, and standardizing data formats. Verifying the effectiveness of cleaning operations through data inspection and validation. Providing clear documentation and code annotations for reproducibility and transparency.

Upon completion, the project will deliver a cleaned version of the FIFA 21 dataset, accompanied by comprehensive documentation outlining the cleaning process and rationale behind each step. Additionally, code snippets and annotations will be provided for clarity and reproducibility.
